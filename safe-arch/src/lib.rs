//! This crate contains wrappers around arch-specific intrinsics (for now, SSE and AVX/AVX2).
//! Those wrappers are not `unsafe` unless the stable-compat feature is enabled.
//! Load, store, prefetch and gather instructions do not have "vanilla" safe wrappers; they instead
//! rely on types from the `bounded-utils` crate to provide fully safe wrappers.
//!
//! WARNING: if stable-compat is enabled, the safe-arch-entrypoint macro does not check that
//! it is used correctly, which could lead to unsoundness. Only enable that feature if you are
//! also testing that your crate compiles without it and you need compatibility with stable Rust.
